# Assignment: Introduction to Classes in Python

# 1. Create a class called `Animal` with a single attribute `name`.
# Example:
# Create an instance/object of `Animal` with the name 'Dog'.

# 2. Add a method `speak` to the `Animal` class that prints "The [name] says hello!".
# Example:
# If the instance has the name 'Dog', the output should be "The Dog says hello!".

# 3. Create another class called `Dog` that inherits from the `Animal` class.
# Example:
# Create an instance of `Dog` with the name 'Buddy'.

# 4. Add a method `bark` to the `Dog` class that prints "Woof!".
# Example:
# If the instance is a dog, calling the method `bark` should output "Woof!".

# 5. Create a class called `Person` with attributes `name` and `age`.
# Example:
# Create an instance of `Person` with the name 'Alice' and age 30.

# 6. Add a method `greet` to the `Person` class that prints "Hello, my name is [name] and I am [age] years old."
# Example: If the instance has the name 'Alice' and age 30, calling `greet` should print "Hello, my name is Alice and
# I am 30 years old."

# 7. Create a class called `Rectangle` with attributes `length` and `width`.
# Example:
# Create an instance of `Rectangle` with length 10 and width 5.

# 8. Add a method `area` to the `Rectangle` class that returns the area of the rectangle.
# Example:
# If the rectangle has length 10 and width 5, calling `area` should return 50.

# 9. Add a method `perimeter` to the `Rectangle` class that returns the perimeter of the rectangle.
# Example:
# If the rectangle has length 10 and width 5, calling `perimeter` should return 30.

# 10. Create a class called `Circle` with an attribute `radius`.
# Example:
# Create an instance of `Circle` with radius 7.
# Add a method `area` to the `Circle` class that returns the area of the circle (use 3.14 as the value of pi).
# Example:
# If the circle has a radius of 7, calling `area` should return approximately 153.86.
